TWINKLE: A Digital-Twin-Building Kernel for Real-Time Computer-Aided Engineering

# About Twinkle
TWINKLE is a library for building families of solvers to perform Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of tensors. The common characteristic of these solvers is that the data structure supporting the tuneable solution strategies is based on a Galerkin projection of the phase space. This allows processing and recovering tensors described by highly sparse and unstructured data. For achieving high performance, TWINKLE is written in C++ and uses the Armadillo open source library for linear algebra and scientific computing, based on LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) and BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) routines. The library has been implemented keeping in mind its future extensibility and adaptability to fulfil the different users' needs in academia and industry regarding Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) and data analysis by means of tensor decomposition. It is especially focused on post-processing data from Computer-Aided-Engineering (CAE) simulation tools.

Twinkle's development team is composed by:
#### * Salvador Izquierdo 
MSc in Chemical Engineering and PhD in Fluid Mechanics (2008). During the PhD thesis, carried out in the Combustion Research Lab (LITEC) of the Spanish Research Council (CSIC), he was involved in the development of a computational code for solving multi-scale problems in Fluid Mechanics. This thesis was awarded as the best one in 2008 by the Spanish Society of Numerical Methods in Engineering (SEMNI). He spent a post-doc period funding by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science working at the Politecnico di Torino on the simulation of complex fluid flows. In 2010 he started working at ITAINNOVA as a CFD engineer, where his duties have been focused on the simulation of processes involving soft materials, such as compounding of thermoplastics and nano-composites, or adhesion performance. He is a specialist in the application of ROM techniques to generate reduced order models. He collaborates as well as assistant professor in the Fluid Mechanics department at the University of Zaragoza. He has received the “Juan Carlos Simó” prize for Young researchers awarded by the Spanish Society of Numerical Methods in Engineering (SEMNI). He is currently the head of the Multiscale and Multiphysics Simulation department.
#### * Rafael Rodríguez
A qualified Industrial Engineer since 2006, employed at ITAINNOVA since 2004, he has experience in the application of virtual prototyping tools for the design and development of components in the automotive, home appliances, public works machinery and railway sectors. He is an expert in the modelization of friction, fatigue and fracture phenomena. He participated in  European projects such as KRISTAL (Knowledge-based Radical Innovation Surfacing for Tribology and Advanced Lubrication) and NEMMO (Next Evolution in Materials and Models for Ocean Energy).
#### * Valentina Zambrano 
MSc in Physics by the University La Sapienza of Rome (Italy) and PhD in Medical Physics by the Medical University of Vienna. During her PhD she has worked on a Software for semi-automated dose recalculation in oncological treatments. She has acquired several years of experience as Software developer in different national and international enterprises. Moreover, she has worked at several European research centres, such as CERN (Switzerland), INFN (Italian Institute of Nuclear Energy), the hadrontherapy centre MedAustron (Austria) and the University of Zaragoza. She is currently a Post-Doc in the Multiscale and Multiphysics Simulation department, at ITAINNOVA.

# Getting started
In order to compile Twinkle it is necessary to previously install Armadillo. Armadillo is an open source library for linear algebra and scientific computing, based on LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) and BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) routines. It is therefore necessary to install all three packages following the instructions on Armadillo web page.\
If you prefer using precompiled files, please select a folder corresponding to your OS (available for CentOS Linux 7 and win64). Otherwise compile the library and the executable using the following commands respectively (see more under gcc online documentation).

#### * _CentOS Linux 7 (Core)_
_g++ -c -shared Twinkle.cpp -o Twinkle.so -I"Path_to/armadillo_bits" -I"Path_to/armadillo" -L"/usr/local/lib" -includearmadillo -O2 -g3 -Wall -fmessage-length=0_ 

_g++ -o runTwinkle runTwinkle.cpp Path_to_twinkle/*.cpp -I Path_to_twinkle/ -I Path_to/armadillo -L /usr/local/lib -llapack -lblas –lgfortran_ 

#### * _Ubuntu 16.04_
_g++ -c -shared Twinkle.cpp -o libTwinkle.so -includearmadillo -O2 -g3 -Wall -std=gnu++11_

_g++ -o runTwinkle runTwinkle.cpp Path_to_twinkle/*.cpp -I Path_to_twinkle/ -L -llapack -lblas -lgfortran -larmadillo -std=gnu++11_

The executable file, that uses Twinkle library, provides a help guide for software usage. It can be visualized by typing the -help command.
